Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this project was to create an app within Android Studios that would allow the user to track their events. The users that would have benefitted from this app are those who have lots of different events such as appointments, vacation, hang-outs,
school related activites, etc. This helps the app to have a large audience of potential users as it utilizes the fact that many users have some form of electronic device they carry around which means they would be able to use this app and it saves them from carrying around
a physical planner making it more convient as everything is in one spot and always on the go. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The main screens neccessary for the basics of this app were a log in screen, the ability to send sms messaging, a database, and the screens that let you create, edit, and see the events. My screens were set up so that the buttons were easy to navigate with and the space in
order to type out the events names and put in their date and time were set a measurments that makes it easy to read and tell where to put the data. This is helpful for multiple age groups which helps expand on the audience as older members will be easily bale to see their 
events and will be able to edit them with ease. I kept the colors more muted so that they weren't to bright to look at making it easier at without the user having to adjust their brightness 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The main strategy I wanted to utilize was keeping the code simple yet effective. I broke down the code into multiple classes in order to make it easy to read from a developer standpoint and make it easier to identify where the errors are coming from while running the test.
I also utilized the assignment prompts given to treat this like an actual work proect, I identified which app I was going to propose, identified the users who would utilize the app, and then started figuring out the different screens in order to produce a rough sketch for
the company to look at. This helped going into coding because I already had an idea on how I wanted everything to look so all that was left was to figure out how to put it into coding. These techniques are good to utilize for the future as when I am working on projects for a
company these are steps every developer should have down as it will help ensure the customer is getting what they are looking for while also helping make sure company time is being properly utilzied.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I ran test as I was developing the code this is an important process as it immediately identifies issues that stop the code working at all. An issue I ran into was that I had accidentally mistyped some of the imports so when I attempted to run the code I was getting an error
message saying it failed to identify pieces of the code that require calling to other files. This made it so the code wouldn't run at all and it identified an immediate issue that had it been missed the app wouln't have worked with its intended use. Testing is a very 
important process to always implement as it is what ensures that the customers are getting what they asked for and that the code is running 100%. It is also important to in bigger projects where you are adding in bigger secuirty measures as it helps identify flaws and weak
points that could be exploited by attackers.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I think the main challenge I faced other then creating the code was the fact I hadn't used Android Studios before. When I first started building the project I wanted to use the simple yet effective method however I wasn't sure how to add in additional files and res that 
still be utilized, however after messing around and adding in different files until I identified what files I needed for the project I was able to figure out how to break everything apart. I also think that by adding in two value files that were specifically for colors and
strings it made it easy when I was adding them to my files as I didn't have to reidentify them to the code so it knew what I was doing, I just had to tell it to call upon the files and it made it easier and faster to code in the colors for the different screens making the 
code look cleaner. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I would say for this being my first time using an app creator ide and making my own app the log in screen and database I put in is particularly successful in showing the skills and the knowledge I learned within the class as I was able to effectively set up the screen so it
will check for authentication of the user and I was able to get the database set up so the user can put in the date and time of their events and the app will be able to recognize and offer them future dates depending how far away their events are.
